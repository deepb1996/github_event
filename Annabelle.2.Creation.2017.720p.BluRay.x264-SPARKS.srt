1
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,389
Think you could hide
from me, did you?

2
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,100
Did you read what it said?
It said, "Found you!"

3
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,531
- It means I tickle...
<i>- Samuel.</i>

4
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,647
<i>Bee.</i>

5
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,023
That's enough.

6
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,855
You don't want to get overheated.

7
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,116
- I'm not.
- You sure?

8
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,728
Good. Because now it's my turn!

9
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,910
Dad, help!

10
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,288
You need help?
Oh, sure, I can help tickle you.

11
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,743
I think the bottom of these feet
might be very ticklish.

12
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,262
Time for bed, Bee.

13
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,021
Thank you.

14
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,649
Mmm...

15
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,146
Love you, Mommy.

16
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
Love you more.

17
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,663
Mommy?

18
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,388
Just for a little while.

19
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,538
Thanks.

20
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,429
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

21
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,400
<i>You make me happy
when skies are gray</i>

22
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,607
- Mommy?
- Mmm-hmm?

23
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,909
Can we play dollies when we get home?

24
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,167
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up,

25
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,703
I could play dollies with you
all afternoon.

26
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,292
- Sam!
- Yes!

27
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,626
<i>Sam!</i>

28
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,666
Morning, Sam.

29
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,005
- Morning, Esther.
- Morning.

30
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,090
Hey, there, busy Bee.

31
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,549
Sam, just wondering if you got
that order of mine ready yet.

32
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,811
I got customers coming into my store
every day, asking about your dolls.

33
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,189
You can send your son over tomorrow, Vic.
They're ready.

34
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,515
Well, hallelujah.

35
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,650
I guess prayers do get
answered, don't they?

36
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,935
They do.

37
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,329
All right, well, thank you so much.

38
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,354
Y'all have a good Sunday.

39
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,561
- You have a good day, too.
- You have a lovely day.

40
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,035
In you get.

41
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,993
Damn it!

42
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,162
Language.

43
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,504
There's a car coming.
Why don't I wave it down

44
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,000
and see if we can get some help?

45
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,167
No, no, no. I got it.

46
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,306
I'll get it!

47
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,440
No!

48
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,906
B-L-U-E.

49
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,530
Okay, pick a number.

50
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,203
Linda?

51
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,868
Um...

52
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,204
- Four.
- Okay.

53
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,747
"You will soon make new friends."

54
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,424
Do mine now.

55
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,587
What's wrong?

56
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,847
I just wish you and me were going
to a new home instead of a new orphanage.

57
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,600
Sweet Sue does, too.

58
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,439
It'd be nice to have a home.

59
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,941
Yeah, but only if you're there.

60
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,444
I don't wanna go anywhere you're not.

61
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,401
So let's swear.

62
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,787
If someone wants one of us,
they get both of us.

63
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,287
Okay. I swear.

64
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,077
Good.

65
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,961
Me, too.

66
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,676
You know what I like most about Sweet Sue?

67
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,879
What?

68
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,925
She looks just like you.

69
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,641
So how much further is it, Father?

70
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,312
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
you're worse than the children, Sister.

71
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,518
The Mullins agreeing to take us in
was a gift from God.

72
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,685
Yeah.

73
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,196
What kind of person isn't excited
about getting a gift?

74
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,486
I should mention, don't be alarmed if you
don't see much of Mrs. Mullins at first.

75
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,657
She has a condition, you see.

76
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,541
She was in an accident years ago.

77
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,045
<i>You girls would do well
to help her if need be.</i>

78
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,748
It's big.

79
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,409
<i>Janice,</i>

80
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,986
you need help?

81
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,702
No, thanks. I can manage.

82
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,586
Sister.

83
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,875
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak,

84
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,961
but she's getting stronger every day.

85
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,802
She won't be a burden. I promise you.

86
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,007
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,469
Mr. Mullins, why don't you
show the girls around?

88
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,267
I can unload their belongings.

89
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,599
I'll start inside.

90
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,692
Thank you, Father.

91
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,529
Whoa! This is as big as a castle.

92
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,165
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

93
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,625
If this is our new orphanage, I think
I'm just fine with never being adopted.

94
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,541
There's a TV.

95
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,799
The television no longer works.
The radio, however, does.

96
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,766
This goes on forever.

97
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,522
You're right. We're gonna need a map
to find our way around.

98
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,978
Girls, this way.

99
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,777
As you can see, the dining room is more
than adequate to accommodate all of us.

100
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,401
Look in here.

101
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,945
Let's stay together.

102
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,496
Mrs. Mullins and I stay in here.

103
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,300
Feel free to use the rest
of the downstairs as you see fit.

104
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,177
Your rooms are upstairs.

105
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,971
Mr. Mullins,

106
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,679
is there some way Janice and I
could maybe stay down here?

107
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,009
Me, too.

108
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,552
I'll be fine.

109
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,286
I installed it years ago for my wife.

110
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,447
Hasn't been used in ages.

111
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,457
<i>But it works fine.</i>

112
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,455
Try it, Jan.

113
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,213
If you don't, I will.

114
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,214
Up is up. Down is down.

115
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,886
But it won't work

116
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,553
unless you click the seat belt in,

117
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,105
like this.

118
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,646
Simple.

119
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,155
Thank you.

120
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,756
<i>I got dibs on next!</i>

121
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,439
Wow, nice.

122
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,446
I guess this is ours.

123
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,196
Let's take that side.

124
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,864
<i>Kate and Tierney can have these.</i>

125
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,617
What about Linda and me?

126
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,879
Relax, Janice. This is a big house.
There are other bedrooms.

127
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,502
Why can't Linda and me
have those beds over there?

128
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,714
Okay. But then where
would Kate and Tierney sleep?

129
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,219
Wow.

130
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,810
This is neat.

131
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,587
Locked,

132
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,503
and it stays that way, too.

133
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,813
Hey, Jan.

134
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,435
In here.

135
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,251
<i>Hey,</i>

136
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,213
wanna be bunkmates?

137
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,343
- Hey, Sister Charlotte, can we...
- Oh, Lord,

138
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,677
please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people near heart attacks.

139
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,007
Sorry.

140
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,676
What is your emergency?

141
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,014
Can we go exploring?

142
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,349
Help Father Massey
with your things first, and then...

143
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,656
But Mr. Mullins is doing that.

144
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,824
But that doesn't mean you're...

145
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,271
You know how Father Massey is.
We don't wanna get in the way.

146
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,984
- Fine.
- She said, "Okay"!

147
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,820
But look out for one another!

148
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,030
You coming, Jan?

149
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,453
Maybe in a little while.

150
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,452
Well,

151
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,620
maybe I'll stay, too.

152
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,210
Because you feel sorry for me?

153
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,838
Well...

154
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,629
You promised you wouldn't treat me
any differently.

155
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay.

156
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,183
See you!

157
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,068
Dear Lord, thank you
for bringing us all together.

158
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,820
Dear Lord, thank you
for bringing us all together.

159
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,366
Bless this food for our use...

160
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,961
And us to thy service.

161
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,210
Fill our hearts with grateful praise,

162
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,840
and help us give you glory
each day through.

163
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,010
<i>Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</i>

164
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,390
Amen.

165
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,729
If you'll excuse me.

166
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,974
Carol.

167
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,739
Keep to your own business.

168
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:13,253
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

169
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,132
Please, God, help Linda and me find
a good home that keeps us together...

170
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,342
So we can finally be real sisters...

171
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,973
With good, loving parents...

172
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,475
That hate homework as much as we do.

173
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,184
But even if they don't, that's okay, too.

174
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,766
<i>Amen.</i>

175
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,945
"Find me"?

176
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,827
Nancy?

177
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,243
Carol?

178
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,333
Are you guys in here?

179
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,092
Forgive me, Father,

180
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,009
for I am about to sin.

181
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,579
I heard this is where Mr. Mullins
keeps his wife.

182
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,126
Does she really wear a mask?

183
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,538
Yeah, she looked like a doll.

184
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,751
Mrs. Mullins, you down there?

185
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,197
Stop it.

186
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,046
I think he seems nice.

187
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,015
Why don't you go find Janice,
see what she's up to?

188
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,221
Why?

189
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,136
So you can talk about boys?

190
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,312
Well, do you wanna talk about boys?

191
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,227
Gross.

192
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,437
No.

193
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,109
I wanna play a game.

194
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,816
Okay, let's play hide and seek.

195
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,356
<i>You go hide, and we'll come look for you.</i>

196
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,866
Okay.

197
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,915
So are we gonna look for her?

198
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,367
Maybe.

199
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,841
Bless you.

200
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,335
Thank you.

201
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,670
What are you doing?

202
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,932
I asked Mr. Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom,

203
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,842
and he graciously agreed.

204
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,935
<i>Would you like to help?</i>

205
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,598
What's wrong?

206
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,226
I have a sin to confess.

207
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,190
Forgive me, Sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

208
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,406
- It's been...
- At least two weeks.

209
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,535
At least two weeks
since my last confession.

210
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,014
There's this room upstairs
that we're not supposed to go into.

211
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,836
But you did anyway.

212
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,081
How'd you know?

213
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,717
Because, otherwise,
why would you be telling me about it?

214
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,139
Well, the door was already open.

215
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,926
I don't know how because Mr. Mullins
always keeps it locked.

216
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,099
When I went inside,
there was this little doll,

217
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,181
- and it was really strange in there.
- Janice.

218
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,975
Weird things started to happen.

219
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,485
Janice, listen to yourself.

220
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,444
What do I always say?

221
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,364
A sin is a sin, no matter the context.

222
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,907
More importantly,
you absolutely cannot disobey the Mullins.

223
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,618
We only just got here,

224
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,664
and they're doing a very generous thing
by allowing us to stay with them.

225
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,085
If they decide to no longer have us here,

226
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,219
we'll all be split up.

227
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,594
So next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule,

228
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:33,103
think of how that could affect
the other girls, first.

229
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,731
Do you understand me?

230
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,608
Yes. I'm sorry, Sister. I wasn't thinking.

231
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,440
It's okay, love.

232
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,858
For your penance, pray one Hail Mary,

233
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,153
and unpack three of these boxes.

234
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,409
What are you guys doing?

235
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,754
Unpacking boxes.

236
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,171
Oh.

237
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,888
This place is so creepy.

238
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,361
What was that?

239
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,488
What was that?

240
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,417
How dare you!

241
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,085
Oh, Mr. Scarecrow.

242
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,786
Oh.

243
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,290
Found you.

244
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,742
You're not very good at hiding.

245
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,419
Years of neglect have affected
the counterbalance.

246
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,296
There. That should keep the draft down.

247
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,805
Thank you.

248
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:09,111
That was taken in Romania
at a convent of cloister nuns.

249
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,442
They have little contact
with the outside world,

250
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,073
but I became very close to these three.

251
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,658
That's Sister Maria. That's Sister Anna.
And that's Sister Lucia.

252
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,286
Who's this?

253
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,704
I don't know.
I don't think I even met her.

254
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,668
Is there anything else you need?

255
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,173
No, thank you.

256
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,720
Good night.

257
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,887
Good night.

258
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,877
Ooh, I like him.

259
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,727
Which one would you marry?

260
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,566
Oh, I don't know.

261
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,027
I guess I'll just have to date all of them
to find out.

262
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,030
I just want his eyebrows.

263
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,235
His eyes.

264
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,870
He's very handsome.

265
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,190
Night time is when Mrs. Mullins
gets her powers.

266
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,693
That's why she's in bed all day,
but at night,

267
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,728
she can go wherever she wants.

268
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,569
She needs to, so she can feed.

269
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,110
And if you look directly at her,
you'll die.

270
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:44,281
And to get you to look, she'll keep
saying your name over and over

271
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,290
till you can't stand it.

272
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,911
Wait.

273
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,088
Nancy. Nancy.

274
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,753
- Nancy!
- No, Mrs. Mullins. No!

275
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,259
<i>Nancy.</i>

276
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,765
Shh!

277
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,892
Oh...

278
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,815
No.

279
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,113
She's ready to feed.

280
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,107
Carol!

281
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,275
Carol!

282
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,284
- Carol!
<i>- Stop it.</i>

283
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,338
- We're not supposed to be up.
- Well, you were doing it, too.

284
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,488
Me?

285
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,798
Okay, why isn't he answering her?

286
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,490
- Nancy.
- Don't look at her.

287
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,534
No! No, please, please, please!

288
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,338
<i>Please! No, please. Please.</i>

289
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,049
<i>- Please, God. Please.</i>
- Please.

290
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,760
<i>She's gone.</i>

291
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,855
She's gone. She's gone.

292
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,767
What's going on?

293
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,495
- What on God's Earth?
- Miss Sister Charlotte!

294
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,896
- Mrs. Mullins!
- She was here.

295
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,360
- We heard her.
- In this room.

296
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,833
She was standing right over there.

297
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,904
Who?

298
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,569
Your wife, apparently.

299
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,409
They said she was just in here.

300
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,948
<i>Oh, that's impossible.</i>

301
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,583
My wife hasn't been able
to walk for years.

302
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,312
<i>Girls.</i>

303
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,227
Girls!

304
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,775
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

305
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,128
You okay, Nance?

306
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,092
Did you really see Mrs. Mullins
in your room last night?

307
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,261
Yes. We swear. We were under the covers...

308
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,055
Nancy, stop it.

309
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,440
We just freaked ourselves out last night.
You know that.

310
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,000
Mrs. Mullins?

311
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,914
<i>Sister Charlotte,</i>

312
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,247
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?

313
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,045
Of course.

314
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:58,160
<i>All of you are more than welcome
to stay as long as you need.</i>

315
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,329
<i>It's good to hear some life again.</i>

316
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,631
We've been cooped up here so long,
I'd forgotten what that sounded like.

317
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,512
<i>What a lovely picture.</i>

318
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:15,222
She was taken from us
at an early age, unfortunately.

319
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,689
If you could turn away
for a moment, Sister?

320
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,399
Yes, of course.

321
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,403
I'm very sorry to hear
about your daughter.

322
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,365
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in Heaven.

323
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,537
I wish that were true.

324
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,788
<i>The other night, dear,
as I lay sleeping</i>

325
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:03,994
<i>I dreamed I held you in my arms</i>

326
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:09,959
<i>But when I woke, dear, I was mistaken</i>

327
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:15,222
<i>And I hung my head and cried</i>

328
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:20,802
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

329
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,647
Oh, my gosh.

330
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,322
You shouldn't be in here.

331
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,282
Well, neither should you.

332
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,337
Whose room is this, anyways?

333
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,669
<i>The Mullins had a daughter.</i>

334
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,504
<i>It was hers.</i>

335
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,212
"Had" one?

336
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,006
I think she died.

337
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,682
And I think that was her
playing the music, too.

338
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,519
Stop trying to scare me.

339
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,529
I'm not. It's the truth.

340
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,315
Then why are we in here?

341
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,903
- We should leave.
- No.

342
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,072
No.

343
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,085
Linda,

344
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,170
what is it?

345
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,337
We shouldn't be in here.

346
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,056
Okay.

347
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,391
I'll leave in a minute.

348
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,553
Well, I'm going.

349
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,957
Who's doing that?

350
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,684
Hi.

351
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,485
You're the Mullins' daughter, aren't you?

352
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,577
What happened to you?

353
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,533
Will you help me?

354
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,459
What do you need?

355
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,884
Your soul!

356
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,942
Charlotte!

357
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,860
Sister Charlotte!

358
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,308
No! No!

359
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,106
How do you feel?

360
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,567
Give her some space.

361
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,236
<i>Girls,</i>

362
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,193
Janice is feeling a little down right now,

363
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,362
so we need to do what we can
to support her.

364
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,074
Time, I think, is all she needs.

365
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,582
She'll walk again though, right?

366
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,421
We'll have to see.

367
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,715
You need sleep.
That's gonna help you with the healing.

368
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,638
I can't stay here, Sister Charlotte.

369
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,224
We can't stay here.

370
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,139
We need to leave.

371
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,978
Leave?

372
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,730
And go where?

373
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,476
There isn't anywhere else for us to go.

374
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,151
I didn't fall down those stairs.

375
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,317
Something threw me.

376
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,736
What do you mean?

377
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,910
You always say that,

378
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,918
even though we can't see God, we can...

379
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,796
We can feel his presence.

380
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:14,670
Well, in this house,
I feel a different kind of presence.

381
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,507
What kind?

382
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,684
An evil one.

383
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,264
It's coming after me.
Coming after my soul.

384
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,602
Your soul?

385
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,938
Because I'm the weakest.

386
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,977
No, darling.

387
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:35,899
Listen, the devil preys
on those weak in faith,

388
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,700
<i>not weak of flesh or bone.</i>

389
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,872
You are as strong as any of us, Janice.

390
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,161
Stronger.

391
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,435
<i>You're quiet, Samuel.</i>

392
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,892
I think it was a mistake

393
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,895
to bring the girls here.

394
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,189
Why?

395
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,231
The girl...

396
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,525
The girl that fell.

397
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,778
Maybe she didn't fall.

398
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,913
<i>Maybe...</i>

399
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,412
It was an accident.

400
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,244
That's all it was.

401
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,753
Accidents happen.

402
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,219
It's been quiet for 12 years.

403
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,933
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls

404
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,761
instead of frightening them away.

405
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,526
<i>You'll be better soon.</i>

406
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,063
I don't think so.

407
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,444
Not this time.

408
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,951
But you have to.

409
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,738
Pretty soon, we'll find a new home.

410
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,661
No one's gonna want me now.
I'd just be a burden.

411
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,455
But you swore we'd stick together.

412
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,125
I take it back.

413
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,805
Maybe I won't get adopted.

414
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,727
You will.

415
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,393
You know why?

416
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,983
Because you're special.

417
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,690
You're gonna get adopted
by a nice family somewhere,

418
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,697
and they're gonna spoil you so much.

419
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:48,159
You're gonna have so many dolls that you
won't even be able to name all of them.

420
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,157
Sure, I can.

421
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,701
Janice one.

422
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,245
Janice two, Janice three.

423
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,039
<i>Linda?</i>

424
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,958
<i>Time for bed.</i>

425
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,588
I wish you'd come upstairs.

426
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,886
I don't wanna sleep alone.

427
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,178
Here.

428
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,063
Take Becca.

429
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,935
This way,

430
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,601
I'll always be with you.

431
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,441
Then you should have Sweet Sue.

432
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,198
Thank you.

433
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,747
Remember, before all of this,

434
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:38,377
when we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night?

435
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,757
And eat all the chocolate in the pantry?

436
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,128
Father Massey was convinced
that we had mice.

437
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:50,768
"Oh, Lord.
Please cleanse my soul of all my sins,

438
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:55,853
- and cleanse our house of these mice!
- These mice!"

439
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,485
No matter what happens,

440
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,699
nothing can erase all of those things
we did together.

441
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,665
Night, Linda.

442
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,959
Good night, Janice.

443
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,087
A little sunlight will do you some good.

444
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,390
I don't think the sunlight can fix
what's wrong with me.

445
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,600
You mustn't give up hope.

446
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,139
Hope is a home unto itself.

447
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,980
Dwell in it, and it will protect
and keep you.

448
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,984
What book of the Bible is that from?

449
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,737
The book of Charlotte.

450
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,621
But that doesn't make it any less so.

451
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,240
Are you okay here?

452
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,585
The sunlight actually feels kind of nice.

453
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:51,791
I told you.

454
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,006
Too low.

455
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:30,909
Sister Charlotte?

456
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,004
No! No, no, no!

457
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,128
Stop, please!

458
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:18,437
Janice!

459
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,604
Janice!

460
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,033
What's going on?

461
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,494
I couldn't get out.

462
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,204
Are you okay?

463
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:37,623
I'm fine.

464
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,924
I'm worried about Janice.

465
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,680
A few nights ago, she wanted to leave.

466
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,261
Why'd she wanna leave?

467
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,973
Probably because this place
is off the wall.

468
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:58,224
She told me the Mullins' daughter
was coming for her.

469
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,732
The Mullins had a daughter?

470
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,898
She died a long time ago.

471
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,319
So she's seeing ghosts?

472
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,950
Keep your voice down.

473
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,989
So she's seeing ghosts?

474
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,871
I guess.

475
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,241
Well, you guys saw something.

476
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,834
That wasn't a ghost.
Ghosts can only be of dead people.

477
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,465
But how does that explain what you saw?

478
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,717
Unless it really was Mrs. Mullins.

479
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,511
Or something was just trying to scare you.

480
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,307
<i>You guys are doing a good job
of that on your own.</i>

481
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,145
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

482
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,314
I don't think so.

483
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,902
Of course you don't.

484
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,238
You'll know what
I mean when you're older.

485
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,493
Now go. Get to bed.

486
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,819
What are you waiting for?

487
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,198
Nothing.

488
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:36,988
You like it?

489
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,206
It's nice.

490
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,214
It's not my finest work.

491
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,885
You seem troubled.

492
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,395
<i>Maybe I can help.</i>

493
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,398
I don't think so.

494
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,568
Talking about the things
that bothers us, sometimes,

495
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,321
it's all the help we need.

496
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,237
Well,

497
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,827
it's Janice.

498
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,615
She's acting funny.

499
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,204
"Acting funny"?

500
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,207
She says

501
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,748
she's seen your daughter.

502
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,253
My daughter

503
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,554
has been dead for a very, very long time.

504
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,601
I know, but, you see,

505
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,732
Janice went into her bedroom.

506
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,143
She what?

507
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:53,111
She knows she wasn't supposed to,
but she found this doll and...

508
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,273
What doll?

509
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,951
The one in the white dress.

510
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,657
That's impossible.

511
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,743
That doll was hidden away.

512
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,578
She mustn't go near that doll.

513
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,663
Do you understand me?

514
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,462
Janice, I told you not to use that room.

515
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:39,713
<i>Please don't take
my sunshine away</i>

516
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,213
Stay here.

517
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,845
Mr. Mullins?

518
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,017
Mr. Mullins, are you okay?

519
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:56,581
Go get ready for bed, girls.
I need to speak to Mrs. Mullins.

520
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,065
Linda, what are you doing?

521
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:11,200
This doll,

522
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,486
it's hurting Janice,
and it killed Mr. Mullins.

523
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,659
I'm getting rid of it!

524
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,667
Linda, let's go back.

525
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:40,976
Linda?

526
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,188
No! No!

527
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,668
- What is that?
- Who cares? Run!

528
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,309
Janice. Janice, I got rid of it.

529
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,974
I got rid of the doll.

530
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,270
<i>Janice?</i>

531
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,900
Janice?

532
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,910
- What's going on?
- Where's Janice?

533
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,696
- I don't know.
- Go find her.

534
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,198
Hurry!

535
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,792
- What's going on?
- No!

536
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,458
No! Get that thing away from me!

537
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,130
It's back. I knew it was back.

538
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:53,919
What is it?

539
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,839
Evil.

540
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,634
The devil itself.

541
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,512
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

542
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:07,316
After Samuel and I lost our daughter,

543
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,815
we prayed and promised our devotion

544
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,652
to whatever power would allow us

545
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:17,694
to speak or see our beloved girl again.

546
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,866
<i>It started small, the contact.</i>

547
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:24,667
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

548
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,748
<i>You make me happy...</i>

549
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,919
<i>But it was her, our busy Bee.</i>

550
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,334
<i>We knew it was her.</i>

551
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,307
<i>She wanted permission to move into
the doll so she could be with us forever.</i>

552
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:56,491
<i>We said yes,
and that's when it became stronger.</i>

553
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,163
<i>Soon, we could actually see her.</i>

554
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,459
<i>Only in fleeting glimpses,
but it was enough.</i>

555
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,912
<i>Our beloved Bee,</i>

556
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:11,998
<i>our darling.</i>

557
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,087
Annabelle?

558
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,014
<i>Even though I couldn't hold her,</i>

559
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,521
<i>it was comforting
just to have the buzz of activity again.</i>

560
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:36,443
<i>But we soon realized
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.</i>

561
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:39,923
Esther?

562
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,087
Esther?

563
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,810
It was a demonic presence,

564
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,775
and it was using our Annabelle

565
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:02,316
to manipulate us
into giving it a soul it could inhabit.

566
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:06,909
It tried to take mine,
but Samuel reached out to the Church.

567
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:12,584
They saved my soul, but the evil
was still attached to that doll.

568
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,955
<i>So we locked it away</i>

569
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,133
<i>where it could be surrounded
by the word of God.</i>

570
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,130
<i>It was quiet for all these years.</i>

571
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,350
I thought the evil was contained.

572
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:14,180
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

573
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,725
<i>But we ended up giving it
just what it wanted.</i>

574
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,231
<i>You are sunshine</i>

575
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,359
<i>My only sunshine</i>

576
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:26,617
<i>You make me happy when skies are gray</i>

577
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,738
<i>You'll never know, dear...</i>

578
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,288
Janice.

579
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,377
<i>Please don't take my sunshine away</i>

580
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,754
She can walk.

581
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,460
It's just us, Janice.

582
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,881
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

583
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,640
- Sister Charlotte!
- Look!

584
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,897
- It's Janice. She did this to me.
- Look what she did!

585
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,728
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

586
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,564
And stay together.

587
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,442
They're on the way.
Let's get somewhere safe.

588
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:14,243
What do we do?

589
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,704
We can't just leave her here, can we?

590
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,680
<i>Mrs. Mullins?</i>

591
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,593
Mrs. Mullins?

592
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,104
Mrs. Mullins?

593
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:57,370
Girls!

594
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,706
Let's go. Now!

595
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,668
Forgive me, Sister, for I have sinned.

596
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,374
- Charlotte! Charlotte!
- Let's go!

597
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:44,454
Linda!

598
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,134
<i>Go, Kate! Get help!</i>

599
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,797
Or you could help me.

600
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:06,768
The truck!

601
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:09,730
Come on, come on.

602
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,793
Come in. Close the door! Close the door!

603
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,036
Come on! Go!

604
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:23,960
- No!
- Why?

605
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,621
Go! Go!

606
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,545
<i>Look.</i>

607
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:31,335
<i>Okay.</i>

608
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:32,965
- No!
- Hurry!

609
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,721
- I'm trying!
- It's there!

610
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,686
- It's not moving.
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

611
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:45,895
Guys!

612
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:50,778
Guys! Guys!

613
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,063
Wait. Wait.

614
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:53,861
The scarecrow.

615
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,780
<i>What scarecrow?</i>

616
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,153
<i>What?</i>

617
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:02,039
- Kate!
- Get out!

618
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:23,937
The barn! The barn!

619
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,435
Carol.

620
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:34,777
What?

621
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,156
No! No! No!

622
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,118
Nancy, I can't get the door open.
Is it locked?

623
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,123
Can you get it from your side?

624
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,626
Girls?

625
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:48,370
<i>Nancy?</i>

626
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:13,125
No.

627
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:23,386
No. No, no, no!

628
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:43,795
<i>Lord, help me.</i>

629
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,136
Lord, help. Help.

630
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,973
Carol, it's me. It's just me.

631
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:53,305
Come on.

632
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,071
<i>Linda?</i>

633
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,396
No.

634
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:07,026
Shoot.

635
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:20,081
No!

636
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,462
No!

637
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,701
Sister Charlotte?

638
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:12,030
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

639
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,699
She looks just like you.

640
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,378
Oh, my...

641
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:57,775
Linda?

642
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,950
Where are you, Linda?

643
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:06,955
Linda?

644
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:19,885
Linda?

645
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:21,682
Come out and play.

646
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,372
Found you!

647
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,746
You swore that, if I found a home,
you'd come, too.

648
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,668
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

649
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:58,006
You go straight to hell.

650
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,170
<i>Janice!</i>

651
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,349
Forgive me.

652
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,472
No!

653
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:12,267
<i>Let me out!</i>

654
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,064
<i>Let me out!</i>

655
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,403
<i>Let me out!</i>

656
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:51,435
Go!

657
01:36:58,855 --> 01:36:59,902
Go!

658
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,160
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

659
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:51,847
Anything?

660
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:53,978
I'm afraid not.

661
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:55,559
Still no sign of the girl.

662
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:57,523
But at her age,

663
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,067
how far could she have gone?

664
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,564
Don't worry.

665
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,032
We'll find her.

666
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:15,450
The house is blessed.

667
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:19,208
Whatever evil was here is no longer.

668
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,878
But the doll.

669
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,586
It was a conduit for the evil.

670
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:29,050
<i>That evil has moved on.</i>

671
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:31,011
<i>Now the doll is just a doll.</i>

672
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:35,346
So which one of you gets this?

673
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,418
How are you holding up?

674
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,168
I'm okay.

675
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:13,425
You know, that wasn't Janice back there.
That was

676
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:16,724
something else.

677
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:22,058
I know.

678
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:02,978
Hi, there.

679
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,984
Welcome. Let's go right inside, shall we?

680
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:07,235
Sure.

681
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:13,777
She mostly keeps to herself and can be
a bit quiet, but she's a lovely girl.

682
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:16,446
She's just been through a lot.

683
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,957
I think you will love her.

684
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:25,497
Hello. There's someone here
to see you, sweetie.

685
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:32,257
I wanna introduce you
to Mr. and Mrs. Higgins.

686
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,516
And you must be...

687
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:37,842
Annabelle.

688
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:39,135
<i>Annabelle?</i>

689
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:41,516
What a lovely name.

690
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,520
We brought you a present.

691
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,854
I hope you like dolls.

692
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,570
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

693
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:39,953
What is it?

694
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,240
- You stay here.
- No, no, no! No, wait!

695
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:44,051
It's all right. It's okay.
It's all right, sweetheart.

696
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,544
I'm just gonna take a quick look.
Call the police.

697
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,973
<i>- Annabelle!</i>
- Hi, Mom.

698
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,125
John?

699
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:40,473
<i>The other night, dear</i>

700
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:42,846
<i>As I lay sleeping</i>

701
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:47,605
<i>I dreamed I held you in my arms</i>

702
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:52,819
<i>But when I woke, dear, I was mistaken</i>

703
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:57,274
<i>And I hung my head and cried</i>

704
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:02,366
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

705
01:44:02,695 --> 01:44:06,950
<i>You make me happy when skies are gray</i>

706
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:12,463
<i>You'll never know, dear,
how much I love you</i>

707
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:17,218
<i>Please don't take my sunshine away</i>

708
01:44:37,021 --> 01:44:41,697
<i>I'll always love you and make you happy</i>

709
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:46,577
<i>If you will only say the same</i>

710
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:51,669
<i>But if you leave me and love another</i>

711
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:56,249
<i>You'll regret it all someday</i>

712
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:01,341
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

713
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:06,096
<i>You make me happy when skies are gray</i>

714
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:11,264
<i>You'll never know, dear,
how much I love you</i>

715
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:16,231
<i>Please don't take my sunshine away</i>
